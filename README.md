# Smart Wires Analytics Onboarding

## Introduction

This repository contains exercises intended to help bring new Transmission
Planning Engineers up to speed with our software development practices in
the Products and Solutions Analytics team at Smart Wires.

## Prerequisites

We use some of the tools popular in the software development and data science
communities to assist in our day-to-day work.

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control),
   which helps track revisions of files and simplifies collaboration
1. [Python 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)):
   a programming language useful for data analysis

   * We recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
     distribution of Python 3, which includes common tools and libraries
     such as Jupyter, pandas, and NumPy
   * If you prefer, you can install the individual components instead:

     1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
     1. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) via `pip install jupyter`
     1. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) via `pip install pandas`
     1. [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) via `pip install numpy`

## Exercises

1. [**First Things First**](01-hello-git/README.md): create a
   [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))
   and workspace on your local filesystem (_clone_).
